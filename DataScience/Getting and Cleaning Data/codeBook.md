4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` contain the data from the downloaded files.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
* `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
